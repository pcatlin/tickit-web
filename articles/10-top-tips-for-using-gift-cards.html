            <h1 class="heading">10 Top Tips for Using Gift Cards</h1>
            <h2 class="subheading">...And Not Losing Your Marbles</h2>

            <p>Ah, the humble gift card. That mysterious bit of plastic (or email) that says, "I thought about
                getting you a present, but then I thought Tesco might do it better."</p>

            <p>Gift cards are brilliant. Until you forget about them. Or lose them. Or find them at the back of a
                drawer next to a congealed hairband and a receipt for a meal deal from 2018. But fear not! Here are
                10 top tips to help you actually <em>use</em> your gift cards — and maybe even feel a bit smug about
                it.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    <h3>Use the TickIt Cards App</h3>
                    <p>First things first: get organised. <strong>TickIt Cards</strong> is the UK’s easiest way to keep track
                        of your gift cards — store them, check balances, and get reminders before they expire. It’s like a
                        personal assistant for your Argos vouchers.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Spend Sooner Rather Than Later</h3>
                    <p>Some gift cards expire. Some shops go bust. And some of us have the attention span of a goldfish on Red
                        Bull. Use them quickly before any of that happens.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Register High-Value Cards</h3>
                    <p>If your card lets you register it online, do it. If you lose it, you might be able to get a replacement.
                        If not, well... congratulations on your new £50 bookmark.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Combine for Power Shopping</h3>
                    <p>Got three £10 gift cards for John Lewis? That’s £30 worth of kitchenware you didn’t need but
                        now <em>desperately</em> want. Stack them and conquer.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Use Gift Cards for Essentials</h3>
                    <p>Groceries, petrol, toothpaste — things you’ll buy anyway. Use gift cards for them and feel like a
                        frugal wizard.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Don’t Use a £50 Card to Buy a £4 Mug</h3>
                    <p>Unless you’re committed to the mug life, aim to spend the full amount. Leftover balances are how gift
                        card companies win. Don’t let them.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Keep Digital Cards in One Place</h3>
                    <p>Email inboxes are black holes. Use TickIt Cards to keep all your digital cards in one spot, rather than
                        searching “eGiftCard-WHSmith-FinalFINAL-revised-v4”.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Re-Gift Like a Pro</h3>
                    <p>If you really won’t use that Caffè Nero card, wrap it up and pass it on. It’s not lazy — it’s efficient
                        recycling with a bow on top.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Use in the Sales</h3>
                    <p>Black Friday. Boxing Day. Random Tuesday markdowns. Use your gift cards when prices drop and feel the
                        adrenaline rush of financial brilliance.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Check the Expiry Dates</h3>
                    <p>Seriously. Some cards give you a year. Others, three months. Use TickIt Cards to set reminders, so your
                        gift card doesn’t quietly become a rectangular regret.</p>
                </li>
            </ol>
