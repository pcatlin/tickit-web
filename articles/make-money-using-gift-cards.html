            <h1 class="heading">How to Make Money by Using Gift Cards to Buy Everything</h1>

            <p>We live in a glorious age where you can buy toilet paper, tacos, and telescopes without ever
                touching cash or a credit card. All you need is a stack of gift cards and the cunning strategy
                of a seasoned grocery store ninja. Welcome to the underground economy of <strong>gift
                    card capitalism</strong>.</p>

            <p>Sounds crazy? It is. But crazy like a fox. Because if you play your cards right (pun extremely
                intended), you can save money, earn rewards, and maybe even <em>make</em> money — just by living
                your normal, everyday, coffee-fueled, Amazon-obsessed life.</p>

            <h2>Step 1: Stack Rewards Like It’s Your Full-Time Job</h2>

            <p>Buy gift cards from places that give you points, cashback, or both. Supermarkets, warehouse clubs,
                and even drugstores often offer <strong>reward points</strong> for gift card purchases. Combine that
                with a credit card that gives you cashback on grocery store purchases and suddenly your £20 Starbucks
                card is coming with a side of airline miles and £1.75 cashback. That’s a free cake pop, people.</p>

            <h2>Step 2: Buy Stuff You Actually Need</h2>

            <p>This is important: don’t buy gift cards for llama grooming salons unless you <em>actually</em> have
                a llama. Use them to buy groceries, gas, clothes, and possibly your child’s endless Roblox addiction.
                You’re not spending extra — you’re just rerouting your normal spending through a reward-generating
                wormhole.</p>

            <h2>Step 3: Resell for Profit (Advanced Users Only)</h2>

            <p>Sometimes you’ll find discounted gift cards online — £100 for £90. Buy low, sell high. Or buy low, use
                to buy stuff, and save money. Either way, <strong>you win</strong>. Just don’t go full Wolf of Wall
                Street on the Subway card market. Stay humble.</p>

            <h2>Step 4: Use <em>TickIt Cards</em> to Track It All</h2>

            <p>Of course, none of this works if you forget what you bought, where the cards are, or whether that £10
                iTunes card is just a coaster now. That’s where <strong><em>TickIt Cards</em></strong> comes in. It's
                the app designed to help you track balances, expiry dates, and make sure every penny is squeezed out of
                that Dobbies card from 2016.</p>

            <p><strong>TickIt Cards</strong> lets you:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Scan and store all your gift cards</li>
                <li>Track remaining balances like a financial hawk</li>
                <li>Get alerts before anything expires (including your patience)</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>The Future is Prepaid</h2>

            <p>Gift cards aren’t just stocking stuffers. They’re economic tools. Weapons of fiscal wisdom. Tiny
                rectangles of power. With the right strategy (and a little help
                from <a href="https://giftcards.tickitreminders.com" target="_blank">TickIt Cards</a>), you can beat inflation,
                impress your accountant, and still have enough left over for a caramel frappuccino.</p>

            <p>So stop letting gift cards gather dust. Use them to buy groceries, gas, gadgets, and glory. Because
                money may not grow on trees — but sometimes, it hides in your wallet with a bow on it.</p>
