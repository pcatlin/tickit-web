            <h1 class="heading">Never Forget About Your Gift Cards Again</h1>
            <h2 class="subheading">Seriously, They're Hiding in Your Drawer</h2>

            <p>Let’s face it — gift cards are the boomerangs of the modern world. You get one, put it “somewhere safe,”
                and months later, when you’re looking for a paperclip or that one battery that still works, there it
                is. £25 to Amazon. Expired.</p>

            <p>We've all been there. The holidays hit, your birthday rolls around, or your coworker — the one
                who still calls you "champ" — decides a generic Visa card says “I appreciate your synergy.” And
                you’re thrilled! Free money! …Until you lose track of it faster than your new year’s resolution to
                stop hoarding condiment packets.</p>

            <p>And what’s worse? That $100 card to "Greg's Tech Emporium" now buys exactly one USB cable, because
                you forgot about it for 14 months. Poof — gone with the wind like your motivation after lunch.</p>

            <h2>Introducing: <em>TickIt Cards</em> – Your Gift Card Bouncer</h2>

            <p>Enter <strong>TickIt Cards</strong>: the app that finally gives your gift cards the attention
                they deserve. It’s like a calendar, a wallet, and a personal assistant who doesn’t judge you — all
                rolled into one tidy little package.</p>

            <p>With <strong>TickIt Cards</strong>, you can:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Add gift cards</strong> from anywhere — Target, Amazon, or that mysterious coffee shop
                    that only accepts Bitcoin and good vibes.</li>
                <li><strong>Track balances</strong> so you don’t awkwardly hand the cashier a card with $0.37 left
                    on it.</li>
                <li><strong>Get expiry reminders</strong> before your card becomes a tiny rectangle of expired
                    regret.</li>
                <li><strong>Scan cards</strong> so you don’t have to type in those 19-digit codes like you're
                    defusing a bomb.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>TickIt doesn’t just help you remember your gift cards. It helps you <em>respect</em> them. And maybe
                even use them.</p>

            <h2>Why You Need This App (Aside from Being Human)</h2>

            <p>Did you know that billions of dollars in gift card value go unspent every year? That’s right —
                somewhere out there, there’s a pile of unused gift cards lounging like lazy cats. Don’t contribute to the national stash of forgotten funds. Be a hero. Or at least a person who uses their Cheesecake Factory gift card <em>before</em> 2029.</p>

            <h2>In Conclusion, Don’t Be That Guy</h2>

            <p>You wouldn’t leave cash on the table. So why leave your gift cards in a dusty drawer, behind expired
                coupons and a mystery mint from 2004?</p>

            <p><strong>Download <em>TickIt Cards</em> today</strong> and start keeping track of your gift cards like
                the responsible adult we both know you're pretending to be. Your future self — and possibly Greg
                from Tech Emporium — will thank you.</p>
