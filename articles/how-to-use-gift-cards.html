            <h1 class="heading">How to Use Gift Cards </h1>
            <h2 class="subheading">Without Losing Your Mind</h2>

            <p>We’ve all been there. It's your birthday. Someone hands you a card with a smile and says, “Got you a
                little something!” You open it, and inside... it’s a <strong>gift card</strong>. Hooray! But
                fast-forward six months, and that card is still buried at the bottom of your sock drawer, gently
                gathering dust and existential shame.</p>

            <p>Using gift cards should be simple, right? And yet, somehow, they vanish like your willpower during a
                Greggs lunch run. But not anymore. It’s time to take control. Here’s how to use gift cards like a
                boss — and maybe even enjoy the process.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    <h3>Actually Know What You Have</h3>
                    <p>First things first: do a treasure hunt. Wallets, junk drawers, coat pockets, that mystery kitchen
                        drawer full of takeaway menus. Dig out every card and e-gift you can find. The goal? <strong>Know
                            your arsenal</strong>.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Use TickIt Cards to Stay Organised</h3>
                    <p>This is where the magic happens. Download <strong>TickIt Cards</strong>, the app that helps you
                        store,
                        track, and <em>remember</em> to use your gift cards before they expire. No more missed Starbucks
                        lattes or forgotten M&S shopping sprees.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Don’t Wait for a Special Occasion</h3>
                    <p>Gift cards are <em>money</em>. Use them for everyday spending — groceries, socks, stationery,
                        impulse
                        candles. There’s no rule that says you can only spend your Boots voucher when Mercury is in
                        retrograde.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Stack 'Em High</h3>
                    <p>Some retailers let you use multiple gift cards in one transaction. So if you’ve got five £10
                        Argos
                        cards, that’s a £50 blender you can use to make one smoothie and then never again. Still, free
                        blender.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Check the Balance</h3>
                    <p>Nothing says “awkward checkout moment” like waving a gift card with £0.03 on it. Use TickIt Cards
                        to check your balances before you try to buy that £4.50 iced coffee with confidence.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Watch the Expiry Date</h3>
                    <p>Some cards expire faster than a takeaway discount code. Don’t let your money vanish into the
                        void.
                        TickIt Cards will alert you when time’s ticking — so you can spend now, cry never.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Get Creative</h3>
                    <p>Use gift cards to buy presents, pay bills (some allow it!), or finally buy that novelty cactus
                        lamp
                        you've had your eye on. The only limit is your imagination — and the terms and conditions.</p>
                </li>
            </ol>

            <hr>
